# asset-allocation

**The project is to create a portfolio starting with a capital of € 5MLN.**

* It is possible to change the composition of the portfolio during the period (10/30/2020-12/04/2020).

* At the end of each week a report must be made.

* Risk free rate 0%.

* Transaction costs 0.3%.

* The goal is to maximize the information ratio, that is the expected excess return (with respect to the benchmark) divided by the volatility of the excess return.
